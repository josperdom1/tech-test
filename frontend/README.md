- 🔐 Add rate limiting
- 🛡️ Implement content security policy

## 🛠️ Development

### Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Build
```bash
# Create production build
npm run build
```

## 🐳 Docker

### Docker Configuration
The project uses a multi-stage Docker build process for optimal production deployment:

1. **Build Stage**
   - Uses Node.js 18 Alpine as base image
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the React application

2. **Production Stage**
   - Uses Nginx Alpine as base image
   - Serves the built application
   - Configured with custom Nginx settings

### Docker Files
- `Dockerfile` - Main production build configuration
- `Dockerfile.test` - Test environment configuration
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Test environment setup
- `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from build

### Running with Docker

#### Production Build
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t frontend-app -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -p 80:80 frontend-app
```

#### Development with Docker
```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Running Tests in Docker
```bash
# Run tests in Docker container
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

### Docker Best Practices
- 🔒 Uses multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- 🚀 Optimized for production deployment
- 🔄 Includes test environment configuration
- 🛡️ Implements security best practices
